					<div class="text">
						Real-time, actionable alerts for patient transitions. We envision a world where healthcare goes uninterrupted.<br><br>
						To always let care teams know, in real-time, when their patients are receiving care and provide tools to respond and deliver interventions. The hospital-to-community transition is fraught with risks to patients. Care teams need better solutions to proactively connect across the continuum and coordinate patient care.

					<div class="text">
						Founded in 2012 by physicians in New York City, Cureatr helps accountable care organizations, hospitals and health systems, specialty care providers, payers and physician group practices track patients in real-time throughout the care continuum and improve care coordination. Cureatr builds networks of Care Transition Notifications (CTNs) paired with a robust mobile care coordination platform. Cureatr’s CTNs alert clinicians in real-time on mobile or desktop applications when an attributed patient is receiving care anywhere within a region and delivers necessary information that is essential to reducing preventable hospitalizations and avoiding readmissions.<br><br>
						We’re a thriving venture-backed healthcare technology company in Tribeca. Think of us like a HIPPA-compliant and patient-centric mobile Twitter feed used by medical providers. We fuse secure messaging with patient “news flashes.” John Smith checks into the emergency room downtown. His kidney disease care manager’s phone buzzes, and she is able to intervene immediately. “Stop! He’s late for his dialysis, reroute him to us ASAP!” Whether you're a nurse in the hospital, a care manager in a skilled nursing facility, a primary care physician, or any other provider in the healthcare ecosystem, we let you know whenever any patient in your care has a clinical event in real time and allow you to communicate directly with the other clinicians on their care team across hospitals and providers. We run on the phone, born mobile for on-the-go clinicians but also available for the desktop via the web browser so administrators and computer-centric clinicians can plug in. We’re already used by dozens of hospital systems, with tens of thousands of clinicians and supporting staff using us to care for millions of patients. And finally, speaking of caring - we care deeply about our employees and strive to provide great culture, camaraderie, environment, benefits, and opportunities for professional and personal growth.
